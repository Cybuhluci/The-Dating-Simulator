# Sonic: The Dating Simulator

Not a studio project. Not polished marketing copy. Just me making a silly, persona-style dating sim in a Sonic-flavored world - a 3D, semi-open-world experience - because it's fun. If that sounds like your kind of nonsense, welcome.

### Quick pitch
A character-driven, Persona-style dating simulator set in a semi-open 3D world. Explore areas, meet NPCs, navigate dialogue choices, build relationships, and unlock character-specific scenes and endings. Balance daily life, activities, and social links to shape your story.

### Core things to know
- Genre: Persona-style dating sim / social sim.
- Scope: Singleplayer only - focused on branching dialogue, routes, and world exploration.
- World: 3D semi-open-world with hubs and explorable areas (not full open-world scale).
- Assets: Mostly placeholder art and sounds while mechanics are tested; art may be swapped if the project grows.
- Spoilers: The project contains story beats and route spoilers in some files - if you want to stay unspoiled, avoid anything that might give a hint of the story or confidant routes, or any folder named "EasterEgg".

### Controls & playtesting notes
- Default controls: keyboard & mouse and gamepad (meant to be played on gamepad tbh).
- Playtesting scope: tuned for single-player story flow, social links, and exploration. Expect placeholder UI and rough transitions.
- When reporting bugs: open an issue and include reproduction steps and screenshots or a short video if possible.

### Status
Prototype / early development. 
Current priorities:
- Completing player movement scripts for "stage gameplay"
- Creating second player movement for the normal world
- Creating racing betting system (do not question)

### Wanna help actually build this game with me?
Cool! I’ll actually respond if you reach out.  
Discord: `cybermuffin.` - I don't have a server; I'm not expecting this to explode in popularity.  
Unity: use Unity 6000 (this project uses the most recent version Unity 6000).  
Render pipeline: URP.

### License & attribution
Code and assets follow the repo license (if present). If there is no license yet, ask before using or redistributing major chunks. Placeholder assets are used from public-domain/free sources, mainly The Models Resource and other community packs.

### Final note
Deliberately rough around the edges. Not aiming for big polish - aiming for something fun to build and play. If you like weird dialogue outcomes, branching nonsense, and messy early prototypes, this is for you.
